        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Adobo comes in many forms from many countries. It can be a powder, a sauce, or a marinade. And each kind of adobo differs depending on whether it’s from Spain, Brazil, Portugal, Mexico or any other number of countries. Adobo spice powder, however, is generally a salt and cumin-based blend mixed with garlic, oregano, and other herbs and spices (the mixture depends on the person blending).We use this Adobo spice powder as a go-to when we’re not sure what we want. We sprinkle this adobo spice mix on corn on the cob, mix it into taco meat, add it to an everyday meatloaf, or rub it onto chicken thighs to be braised in cream and roasted poblano chiles.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_INTRO>Few spices are as addicting as cumin. And, of course, there are plenty of us who prefer salty foods over sweet foods. Dry Adobo seasoning is a cracksy marriage of both worlds. Cumin and salt are blended with turmeric, garlic powder, and other choice spices for a spice mix so darn good you may just skip adding the dry Adobo seasoning to taco meat and freebase it straight from the bag.</SPICE_INTRO>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Many home cooks grind aji amarillo peppers into paste and use them as a condiment to be served at every meal. In parts of South America, the chile is chopped up fresh or reconstituted from its dried form and tossed with chopped onion, lemon or lime, and salt as a salsa. In Peru, many soups and stews require dried aji amarillo peppers (you can’t have a Peruvian-style chicken soup without them).The aji amarillo yellow chili powder is rather new to American markets. Its fruitiness and low heat levels have caused it to be used in quirky ways. It makes for a unique substitute for mustard powder in a pinch. We often add it to banana bread or mix it with honey and use the mixture to glaze a ham.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

In Peru, many soups and stews require dried aji amarillo peppers (you can’t have a Peruvian-style chicken soup without them).North American and European chefs have begun using pre-made aji amarillo pastes in their cooking, but the ones with talent make their own. A few chefs have even begun to swirl them into classic sauces such as béchamel for an Old World meets New World flavor. Use an aji amarillo béchamel for an exquisite mac and cheese, over steamed asparagus, or as a dipping sauce for braised artichoke hearts.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>The aji paprika chile is one that you may call reserved – there’s practically zero heat involved so you may wonder why even call a chile when what we consider the defining characteristic of one is nearly absent. Just like Emma Woodhouse or Elizabeth Bennet, this pepper chooses not to totally conform to what society thinks it should be. After all, heat can be so boring when every other pepper is doing it simply because they’re expected to.Instead, this spice hailing from Mexico and South America is vaunted for its orange-y flavor and mild sweetness. Toasted, the smell of citrus becomes dominant and the pepper flavor that can be so secondary in other chiles debuts itself. For a riff on the standard deviled egg, eschew the powder and blend a toasted and reconstituted whole paprika in with the yolks.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Named after the city of Aleppo, this popular spice is used on everything from kabobs to grilled vegetables. Indeed, nearly all dishes get a small sprinkling of aleppo pepper. Unlike more common red chile flakes, aleppo peppers are much milder. In addition, these peppers are sometimes cured in salt before they’re dried. The result is a slightly salty pepper flake with the flavor of raisins, prunes, and sun-dried tomatoes. The heat level is also more subtle, but still possess a pleasantly slow burn. We encourage you to keep aleppo pepper in a spare shaker at the table. Perfect for finishing off pizza, mashed potatoes, or for giving a bit of kick to soups.Crushed Mediterranean Aleppo pepper flakes have much less spice than those grown in the Middle East due to the more temperate climate producing happier and healthier chiles. In contrast, you’ll find the Mediterranean variety far fruitier. This pepper is the perfect all purpose chile flake for appetizers, pizzas, and meze. Use this in place of black pepper for a while and see if you ever go back.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Allspice, also known as pimenta, Jamaica pepper, Turkish yenibahar, or newspice, is native to the West Indies and the Caribbean. In fact, due to its finicky nature, it’s one of the few spices that are still exclusively grown in its native region. The name allspice refers to its compound aroma that seems like it’s a mixture of mace, clove, cardamom, and cinnamon. The berries are actually plucked when green and are cured in the blazing tropical sun on large concrete slabs until they turn black and their shells become fragrant with oil.Whole Jamaican allspice berries have a place in preserved goods and play an important role in spice blends and rubs like jerk seasoning and garam masala. In addition, it plays a central role in many North American pastries such as gingerbread cookies and pumpkin pie.Whole berries can be ground up and toasted for a fresher, more intense allspice flavor than pre-ground allspice. Whole Jamaican allspice berries are also essential for proper pickling. Buy allspice berries from Spice Jungle today!</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Anise extract is obtained from both the leaves and the seeds of the spice known as star anise. It has a strong, slightly sweet licorice flavor due to the presence of an aromatic compound known as anethole, which is also found in fennel, tarragon and licorice itself. Pure anise oil extract is popular in baked goods from around the world and is also sometimes used to flavor liquor and herbal liqueurs. In Mediterranean countries it is used to flavor apéritifs such as Pernod, Anisette, Ouzo, Raki and Arak and in Latin America it is known as Aguardiente. In Central and Northern European countries, it is used in baking breads and cakes, and in Southeast Asia and India, it is used in curries, more predominantly with fish.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Native to the Mediterranean and the Middle East anise is one of the most prolific spices in the culinary world. While originally used as a medicine for indigestion and ulcers, many cultures quickly found a use for it in the kitchen. From sweets to preserves to liquor, anise made the rounds and became a staple ingredient throughout Europe, Asia, Australia, and soon the Americas.The flavor of anise seed is undeniably licorice-like with a piquant sweetness and mild peppery notes that lends itself well to candy making. For a quick dish that easily utilizes the flavor of anise, peel and cut a carrot into thin coins. Sauté the carrots in butter, a bit of honey, and a teaspoon of anise seed over medium-high heat until softened. You’ll find them to be a delightful side dish with game birds or ham.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Arrowroot powder is the Patrick Dempsey of the spice world. Years ago it was the in-ingredient and was used in everything from bread to jellies for its thickening abilities and supposed (though untrue) nutritional benefits. It was later dropped like a bad habit when nutritionists finally concluded it wasn’t really nutritional at all.In addition, it was mainly produced in the Americas via slave production. As such, many abolitionists and Northerners boycotted arrowroot in preference for corn starch. By the end of the American Civil War arrow root consumption was nearly extinct.Today, arrowroot is being used in kitchens again. Added to sorbets and ice creams it makes for a smooth base and inhibits crystallization, and unlike potato starch or flour it doesn’t cloud a sauce when used as a thickener. Arrowroot is a savior to the modern pastry chef and saucier.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

(As much as one can “discover” anything that millions of people had been farming and using for thousands of years.) Actually, he was simply a tea farmer who set up many successful tea plantations in Assam and was responsible for a majority its marketing and shipment, making Assam one of the most prevalent teas in the world. Assam loose leaf tea hails from, logically, Assam, India.These dried tea leaves brew brisk and malty, has a rather punchy flavor, and possesses a high dose of caffeine. Londoners who first indulged in it this tea often took it with cream and sugar, though a few diehards enjoyed it black. Today, a popular option is to brew the dried tea leaves with cinnamon and honey. Some indie coffee houses also intentionally use coconut, soy, or almond milk as opposed to traditional creamer to contrast the tea’s wilder flavors.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Sugar, salt, smoked paprika, garlic, onion, chile pepper, cumin, coriander, and a few other surprises make up this BBQ seasoning mix. Throw-n-go with this one, but a good massage of this barbecue spice rub into meat the night before will ensure a more flavorful final product.We all have our own ways of using this BBQ seasoning powder at Spice Jungle. Marketing sprinkles it over corn on the cob. The boyfriend of the girl in sales dabbles some into pots of baked beans. One of our guys in accounting mixes in a suicidal amount of ground scorpion chiles for a nearly hallucination-inducing level of heat. Our copywriter? His husband dusts a teaspoon of it in béchamel sauce for mac and cheese swirled with chopped, fire-roasted New Mexico chiles. Really, though, there’s no wrong way to go with our barbecue spice rub.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Berbere spice, Also known as Ethiopian Spice Blend, it’s a crucial component of many Ethiopian and Eritrean dishes such as doro wat. The name “berbere” means “hot” in Amharic (a Semitic language spoken in Ethiopia) and the name is quite appropriate as the blend begins with a tongue-incinerating rush of cayenne, aleppo, and black and white peppers. The heat then subsides to a tender tingle of ginger, mace, cinnamon, and cloves. All this spicy-sweetness is brilliantly interrupted with conversations of ajowan, cumin, fenugreek and other spices and herbs.Add this Ethiopian spice blend to meats, grains, lentils, or root vegetable dishes to generate some incredible flavor. If you want to keep it super simple we enjoy blending our berbere spice mix into soft butter to serve on bread or smear over and under turkey skin before roasting (and speaking of bread, sprinkle some over the surface before baking).</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

It’s a scent that might make you eager to take deep breaths of it or toss the whole bag out the window. However, once reconstituted in water the smell dissipates and all that’s left is the innocent mushroom. Bite into one and enjoy the soft surface, meaty texture and toothsome crunch. The flavor is not at all like the smell. Think a weak black tea, bitter and sweet.The dried cloud ear is mellower than the wood ear mushroom (black fungus) and has a black and grey appearance as opposed to the wood ear’s black and tan. Dried black fungus mushroom is useful in many classic Chinese and Japanese soups and stir-fries. To mix it up, reconstitute it in water and mince it, add the mushroom and the broth to a Thanksgiving cornbread and sausage stuffing to give it a bit more textural intrigue and Asian flavor.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

The texture is squishy and soft, often similar to a gummy candy that you left sitting in a hot car.

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Kala namak is also known as Indian black salt, which is odd because when ground into powder it’s pinkish-white. When whole the crystals are dark purple, bordering on black.Sourced from Northern India this salt has a long history as a medicinal remedy for indigestion, hysteria, and dental health; but also as a popular spice for chaats and breads (we adore it on oven fries). To make kala namak, salt is melted down with aromatic spice and other various minerals. When it cools and re-crystallizes, the salt picks up various aromas and mineral flavors, though the most notable is an eggy, sulfury smell. The flavor is epic with starchy dishes such as sweet potatoes or with egg dishes such as deviled eggs of egg salad.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

The mushroom is the second most expensive mushroom in the world, with the first being the white truffle. Truffles, being rather difficult to farm, garner a high price since the best are usually foraged from the wild. The aroma of the truffle is hypnotic: earthy, musky, rich, and very sweet with complex savory notes.When steeped in salt the salt absorbs the aroma and allows for easy dispersal over food. Use this salt on potatoes, pasta, or other starchy dishes. For a gourmet treat, toss popcorn with melted butter and top with black truffle sea salt.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Also known as the black chanterelle, horn of plenty, black trumpet, and trumpet de la mort or “trumpet of the dead” based on the imagery that buried corpses are playing these fungal horns from beneath the ground. The outside can be rather waxy and black, but the inner part of the horn is usually velvety and charcoal grey. It’s a rather morbid looking specimen with an aroma of air-cured beef. The flavor is highly prized and tastes of an overripe washed rind cheese or a black truffle. The texture is close to that of a soft piece of dry mozzarella when reconstituted.These little lolitas are best cooked up in risottos, ragus, or minced with a bit of pork and shallot and stuffed into ravioli. In addition, black trumpet mushrooms are also excellent served with fresh gnocchi and dressed in gremolata.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

I demand more attention and you are going to give it to me.” And, so, we shall. Not because we have to, but because it deserves it.The Blazei Brazilian cap mushroom is not one to be disregarded. In fact, it’s one that shockingly hasn’t been more widely adopted by chefs and restaurants. The Blazei is a trend-in-waiting, the undiscovered star, and a hip new ingredient waiting to happen. This is due to its almond-like flavor. The smell of these dehydrated mushrooms is all must and neglected attics. The flavor is slightly salty and similar to that of a raw almond both at the start and the finish. The Blazei Brazilian cap mushroom is an ideal addition to lighter soups, salads, or perhaps to serve with wild duck or pheasant.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>An edible mushroom that originated in Western Europe and then spread out through Eastern Europe and South America. They grow under the dark and damp shade of conifer and hardwood forests where they bulk up their fat bottoms and spongy caps (which are porous instead of having gills like most mushrooms). The bolete grows chubby and large; so much so it is often considered the King of the Mushrooms. In fact, some boletes can grow to be 18 inches tall and more than a foot in diameter.The taste of a bolete is hit or miss. Dried, the bolete reeks of dark soy sauce and Chinese black vinegar. That being the case we love to dust freshly made dishes of udon or ramen with this bolete powder. In addition, Bolete mushroom powder makes a seriously addicting rub for beef ribs when mixed with salt, black pepper, and thyme.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>An edible mushroom that originated in Western Europe and then spread out through Eastern Europe and South America. They grow under the dark and damp shade of conifer and hardwood forests where they bulk up their fat bottoms and spongy caps (which are porous instead of having gills like most mushrooms). The bolete grows chubby and large; so much so it is often considered the King of the Mushrooms. In fact, some boletes can grow to be 18 inches tall and more than a foot in diameter.The taste of an edible bolete mushroom is hit or miss. Dried, the bolete reeks of dark soy sauce and Chinese black vinegar. When reconstituted the flavor is far more mellow with a slight fermented hint. This European mushroom is popular served with a runny egg, tucked into pasta dishes, and stirred into risotto. A more modern twist is to grind them into powder in a food processor, mix it with salt and black pepper, and use the mixture as a rub for beef.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Adding sugarcane molasses to refined white sugar makes brown sugar. While it seems counterintuitive adding the molasses back in is a process that can be easily controlled and keeps production costs low.Dark brown soft sugar has a higher molasses content than light brown, meaning the flavor is darker, richer, and huskier. You’ll find more of a blackstrap-y, caramel flavor. In addition, its higher moisture content keeps baked goods soft.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

Of all the cooking techniques out there this one is probably the punk rocker, wearing black torn up jeans and sporting more than one lip piercing – it has attitude and requires a lot of guff to pull off. Slather your meat, chicken, or fish in melted butter and then dredge it in flour and our Cajun blackened seasoning. Place in a cast iron pan so hot the air above it shimmers. Sear hard on all sides until nicely charred on the outside but still tender inside.We also love to add this Cajun blackening spice to egg dishes; deviled eggs, egg salad, and even omelettes benefit from this twangy mixture.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Canadian steak seasoning is a popular spice blend from The Great North and originating out of Montreal. The recipe is credited to Morris Sherman, a broilerman who worked at Schwartz’s, a famous Jewish delicatessen and restaurant in the 1940’s and 50’s. Canadian steak rub was originally used as a pickling spice that was sourced from Jewish-Romanian recipes. Sherman began using it as a meat rub; it became so popular that other delis and restaurants began to copy it. The steak spice blend is now commonly known as Canadian Steak Seasoning or Montreal Seasoning.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Our dried cane syrup is – essentially – white sugar. The difference is that it has undergone significantly less processing, which results in a khaki-colored, large grain sugar that can be used in place of white. The taste is a bit more muted, with a slight honey flavor to it. In addition, this granulated cane sugar has small amounts of potassium, calcium, and B-vitamins in it. We think this allows you to better justify your consumption of it.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Also known as ajowan, ajwain and carom seed, this spice is popular in Pakistani, South Indian, Omani, Egyptian, and Iranian cuisine. It has an abrasive thyme-like flavor with a slight hint of brutalized mint. This flavor is due to the presence of thymol in the seed. Thymol not only provides the flavor but also induces a bitter and somewhat spicy-hot sensation on the tongue. It finishes with a slight numbness or tingle similar to Szechuan peppercorns (imagine the tingle left by carbonation in soda water).Cooking reduces the harshness of carom seed but it remains a rather aggressive spice. Paired with lemon (fresh or preserved) and salt it makes for a popular seafood rub. In addition, ajowan loves to be added to beans and lentils along with oregano and paprika. If you make homemade potato chips or fries, dust them with salt, black pepper, cumin, and ajowan for an addicting snack that pairs well with pale ale beers.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Cascabel means “rattle” in Spanish and it makes sense when you pick it up and give it a shake as this bell-shaped chile works as a tiny maraca. One of the lesser-known chiles in the United States, the cascabel has a loyal following throughout Mexico and lends itself well to sauces and salsas.The flavor is somewhat nostalgic of strawberries, but the aroma is extremely beefy. It sounds odd, but the two balance quite harmoniously; like a steak slathered with a fruit-based barbeque sauce. We at Spice Jungle love to seed and stem cascabels, lightly toast them, and then toss them and a few roasted tomatillos into a blender and roughly chop them into a chunky salsa.

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>WHAT IS CASSIACassia is simply the bark of a laurel tree, a tropical evergreen. Nearly the same as cinnamon, it is sometimes called Chinese Cinnamon. The two spices can be used interchangeably. Cassia is a bit coarser and the taste is not quite as delicate.CULINARY USESCassia bark is perfect for use when making homemade chai tea blends, pickling spice blends, or if you’re brewing your own spirits. In addition, we love to keep these cassia chips on hand for the spice grinder to add to coffee and tea, or to toss into curries or masalas. During winter, take a small spoonful and drop them into simmering pots of cider and wine you plan to mull through the afternoon before a big holiday party. Since we use Korintje cinnamon you get a rounded, sweet cinnamon flavor with a mild bite that won’t overpower your recipe. Use cassia spice in the same manner as Cinnamon.AROMATICS AND FLAVORSIn all appearances, cassia looks and nearly smells the same as cinnamon. Not quite as sweet as cinnamon, it is used more in savory dishes in China. Cassia is also a component in Chinese Five Spice Powder.PRODUCERSCassia is grown in China, Burma, and Indonesia. Coming almost exclusively from these countries.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Also known as the Silver Ear mushroom, White Wood Ear fungus, and Snow Ear fungus the Cauliflower mushroom has long been a staple in traditional Eastern medicines and is often prescribed for tumors or respiratory ailments. It is often used as a cooling element to ward off hot diseases and bring balance to the body’s internal temperature. If you’re suffering a cough then perhaps a simple broth or dessert soup like lok mei might be just what you need.Eastern cauliflower mushrooms require a bit of extra attention than other dried whole mushrooms. They must soak for nearly an hour in a large amount of water as they will greatly increase in size. Afterwards the petals must be washed thoroughly to ensure that all the grit has been filtered out of their folds. The reconstituted mushroom will be frilly, cartilaginous, and milky white.You’ll also find that it doesn’t have much of a flavor. In Chinese cuisine, texture is valued just as much as flavor. The Cauliflower mushroom offers a texture that few other ingredients can: soft, light, smooth, and crunchy. It beguiles the eater and makes the meal all the more playful.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Celery seeds have always been enjoyed in cuisine as a way to add herbaceous pungency to foods. In Northern Europe the seeds are often added to soups and breads, or lightly toasted and added to dressings and cream sauces. In Asia, the seeds are often added with potatoes and tomatoes to highlight their sweeter flavors. A pinch thrown in to a Bloody Mary won’t hurt anyone, either.The aroma of celery seed seasoning is a more intense version of the parent plant. The flavor is green and intensely celery-y (celerified? celery-ac?) but with notes of nutmeg, lemon, and parsley. It starts rather fresh, but finishes bitter and hot. The small seeds are exceptionally strong in flavor so use sparingly. In addition, the seeds are very tiny and can be used whole.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

Once boiling, reduce the heat and allow to simmer for approximately 10-15 minutes, depending on the desired tenderness. Drain and add to your recipe as directed. If you are adding the Cross Cut Celery as is, we recommend adding additional liquid to be absorbed. Our rule of thumb is, 1 cup of dry Cross Cut Celery yields 2 cups cooked.</SPICE_BASIC_APPLICATION>

You’ll find it very forward with ginger, black pepper, and clove making it exceptionally spicy. Cinnamon lays at the heart of each sip, clearing both the mind and sinuses. Finally, it tapers off with the rejuvenating touch of cardamom and allspice berries. Of course, the black tea is there to offer some tannin and pick-you-up.While absolutely wonderful black we love to serve this tea with honey and milk or coconut milk. Chefs love to grind it fine and use this blend in baking or as a rub for pork or beef. Lastly, add a pinch of it to our Assam Tea for a strong black tea with a hint of chai.Lastly, feel free to doctor this all-purpose chai base by adding star anise, lemongrass, rose, nutmeg, licorice root, saffron, vanilla bean, or other favored spices.Fun Fact: For etymology fans, many Middle Eastern and Asian languages use the word “cha,” “chay,” or ”chai“ for the word “tea.” This leads to a conflation when we refer to this tisane as “chai tea.”</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

This is a chile that’s been used in cooking for thousands of years and is thought to be one of the oldest chile cultivars around.Since Tepin peppers are so small they’re very sensitive to rainfall and sunlight, thus their heat can vary not just season to season, but week to week.

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Brown, wrinkled, and looking like a discarded cigar, the brown (aka: meco) chipotle isn't one that’ll win any beauty contests. Looking like old tobacco and smelling like it with a mix of smoke, black powder, and aged leather this whole chipotle pepper is one for those who want powerful flavor from their chiles. These chipotles have been dried and smoked for days longer than their younger siblings, the morita chipotles.Brown chipotles can be used anywhere you use a morita chipotle, this one just offers a huskier flavor with a lot more smoke. Outside of its usual culinary rigmaroles, this dried chipotle chile is fantastic when toasted, ground, and mixed with a bit of ground cinnamon before being swirled into to a cup of hot chocolate.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Chipotles are smoke-dried jalapeño peppers, with the morita variety being the most well-known (the brown chipotle variety being the other). The morita variety of chipotle is smoked for just a few days until a leathery consistency is achieved. The chilies are then lightly toasted over an open flame or a flat grill top, reconstituted in water, and added to dishes to add a medium-level of heat and a desired smokey flavor that just screams Tex-Mex barbeque. Indeed, no barbecue sauce is complete without a morita.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Cilantro also goes by the name coriander, which makes sense because cilantro is the plant that grows the fruit we call coriander seed. The plant is actually a member of the parsley/carrot family and it grows prodigiously throughout Asia, Europe, and Africa. (Yet, somehow it’s nearly impossible to grow at home.)One reason some people find the taste of dried coriander leaves soapy may be partially due to the presence of a particular gene that affects the development of certain olfactory receptors. Scientists are still figuring out the details, but there is a strong evidence to suggest that the dislike for this otherwise innocent and enchanting herb is hereditary. However, geneticists suggest that more likely than not your dislike of dried coriander leaves is simply due to personal taste since this gene only displays itself in less than 10% of the population.Dried cilantro leaves can be used in numerous applications such as marinades, vinaigrettes, rubs, or as a garnish.

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Cinnamon is sourced from the bark of various species of the genus Cinnamomum. Cinnamomum is a tree farmed in much of Asia, though primarily in Indonesia, China, and Vietnam. The spicy and unique flavor, sweet aroma, and warm heat are derived from an essential oil called cinnamaldehyde.To produce cinnamon, a tree is grown for about 2 years. Afterwards, it is chopped down to a stump, from which dozens of small shoots will spring up. The shoots are allowed to mature and thicken to about two inches in diameter. After the green outer bark is shaved off the inner bark is bruised and struck evenly until it releases from the heart of the wood. This inner bark is then removed in large sheets, cut into strips, and air-dried. These strips are then curled into quills of cinnamon that are then further dried in ovens or by baking them outside under the sun. After achieving a sufficient tan the quills are sent on their way to the world.Our cinnamon sticks are made from Korintje cinnamon, otherwise known as Indonesian cinnamon. This cinnamon isn’t as spicy or penetrating as other types of cinnamon, which for quills is a good thing as you can’t control the flavor as easily. Sourced from the rolling hills of Indonesia, Korintje offers an extremely sweet variety that won’t invade a recipe and conquer it in the name of cinnamon. Rather, it strolls in with a sweet word and scintillating personality and sweeps it off its feet.A cinnamon quill also has a certain rustic charm to it. Add them as garnish to drinks or to top a cake laced with cinnamon.Sticks, unlike powder, can be used more than once. After using them in sweet or savory cooking, wash them off and store them somewhere dark to dry. They can be used a second time, or perhaps used for homemade potpourri or other craft projects. We love to place an old stick in a jar of sugar and hide it away. After a few months the sugar will absorb the scent and, ta-da, cinnamon sugar without ground cinnamon.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Cinnamon is sourced from the bark of various species of the genus Cinnamomum. Cinnamomum is a tree farmed in much of Asia, though primarily in Indonesia, China, and Vietnam. The spicy and unique flavor, sweet aroma, and warm heat are derived from an essential oil called cinnamaldehyde.To produce cinnamon, a tree is grown for about 2 years. Afterwards, it is chopped down to a stump, from which dozens of small shoots will spring up. The shoots are allowed to mature and thicken to about two inches in diameter. After the green outer bark is shaved off the inner bark is bruised and struck evenly until it releases from the heart of the wood. This inner bark is then removed in large sheets, cut into strips, and air-dried. These strips are then curled into quills of cinnamon that are then further dried in ovens or by baking them outside under the sun. After achieving a sufficient tan the quills are sent on their way to the world.Our 4”cinnamon sticks for sale are made from Korintje cinnamon, otherwise known as Indonesian cinnamon. This cinnamon isn’t as spicy or penetrating as other types of cinnamon, which for quills is a good thing as you can’t control the flavor as easily. Sourced from the rolling hills of Indonesia, Korintje offers an extremely sweet variety that won’t invade a recipe and conquer it in the name of cinnamon. Rather, it strolls in with a sweet word and scintillating personality and sweeps it off its feet.A cinnamon stick also has a certain rustic charm to it. Add them as garnish to drinks or to top a cake laced with cinnamon.Sticks, unlike powder, can be used more than once. After using them in sweet or savory cooking, wash them off and store them somewhere dark to dry. They can be used a second time, or perhaps used for homemade potpourri or other craft projects. We love to place an old stick in a jar of sugar and hide it away. After a few months the sugar will absorb the scent and, ta-da, cinnamon sugar without ground cinnamon.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Sri Lankan or Ceylon cinnamon is the only true cinnamon, scientifically and historically speaking. Other cinnamons, while of the same genus, are technically cassia bark. However, for the sake of trade and purchase all species are considered “cinnamon.”Cinnamon is sourced from the bark of various species of the genus Cinnamomum. Cinnamomum is a tree farmed in much of Asia, though primarily in Indonesia, China, and Vietnam. The spicy and unique flavor, sweet aroma, and warm heat are derived from an essential oil called cinnamaldehyde.To produce cinnamon, a tree is grown for about 2 years.

These strips are then curled into quills of cinnamon that are then further dried in ovens or by baking them outside under the sun. After achieving a sufficient tan the quills are sent on their way to the world.Unlike Vietnamese cinnamon who has as much subtlety as a drag queen in five-inch sequined peep toe booties, or Korintje Cinnamon who is as sweet as tea served on a Georgia porch, Sri Lankan cinnamon (aka: Ceylon cinnamon) is smooth, and aromatic with hints of citrus, sugar, and butter. That complex aroma is the one you likely grew up with. A perfect all-purpose Ceylon cinnamon powder for using in curries and stews, dusting over oatmeal, spooning into your best barbecue sauce recipe, or mixing into your cookie dough.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

Vietnamese cinnamon is the strongest cinnamon due to a high essential oil content, of which 25% is cinnamaldehyde.Due to this, Vietnamese cinnamon is the butt-kicker cinnamon of the cooking world. Bakers in particular, take note: This is the cinnamon you want for your spice cakes, cookies, and definitely in your cinnamon rolls. We also like a pinch added to a batch of ready coffee grounds or espresso powder before passing through the water to give the everyday cup a bit of pep.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_RECOMMENDED_APPLICATION>Cocoa nibs are cocoa beans that have been roasted, separated from their husks and broken into smaller pieces. Cocoa nibs can be eaten as a snack or added to baked goods and other dishes for added crunch and chocolaty flavor. These flavorful little pieces also have great nutritional value. Cocoa Nibs taste vaguely similar to roasted coffee beans. Cocoa Nibs are always found in small pieces, rather than coffee bean-sized pieces. The flavor is slightly nutty and, while there are definitely some chocolate notes in there, they are primarily going to contribute texture and a hint of bitterness (the same as raw cocoa powder). Cacao nibs do serve to draw out darker notes in chocolate, which is why they are such a popular addition. Cocoa Nibs are one of the best dietary sources of magnesium as well as a good source of calcium, iron, copper, zinc and potassium.

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>The most common types of sugar are beet, cane, and palm. However, throughout Southeast Asia – particularly Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines – coconuts have been used as a source for sugar. The sugar is a deep brown color as it is sourced from the dark sap of the coconut tree and flowers, and not the white coconut flesh.Coconut sap sugar is by far one of the healthiest sugars available. It has a lower glycemic index than other sugars. This healthy white sugar substitute also boasts a high mineral content with surprising levels of magnesium, zinc, potassium, and B-vitamins.Buy coconut sugar in bulk to use as a direct 1-to-1 substitute for white sugar in all recipes. However, the sugar’s brown color will darken the dish considerably.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

It is often described as sweet and floral with hints of white pepper and Navel orange. You might call it cultivated, both in agricultural and worldly senses.The flavors make ground coriander a popular spice across all oceans, from Portugal to Mexico, to India.Ground coriander powder goes stale quickly so use it within six months and, as with all spices, store in an airtight container in a dark and dry space. Any baker would be livid without ground coriander to add to pumpkin pies, sweet potato pancakes, apple cakes, spice cookies, homemade granola, or kugel.Coriander-Maple Granola Recipe4 cups rolled oats1 cup pecans, chopped1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon3/4 cup maple syrup1 cup brown sugar1 teaspoon vanilla extract2 T orange juice2 T orange zest1 cup dried apricots1. Preheat your oven to 350ºF and adjust the top rack to the middle of the oven. Place the oats, pecans, coriander powder, and cinnamon in a large bowl and mix together. Whisk together the maple syrup, vanilla, orange juice and zest, and brown sugar in a saucepan and place over medium heat until almost smooth.2. Pour syrup mixture over oats mixture. Stir gently to combine and the oats are well-coated. Spread out onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or foil. Bake for twenty minutes. Cool completely. (If some of the granola is still sticky and wet bake it for another 7-10 minutes.) Break into pieces and add the dried apricots. Store in an airtight container.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Okay, but really, what is it? Potassium hydrogen tartrate is a potassium acid salt left behind by grapes during the fermentation process. It’s the main acid in winemaking and during the process this acid can crystallize into “wine diamonds” and settle with other sediment at the bottom of whatever vessel is being used to ferment the wine. The crystals are purified and ground into the powder we call Cream of Tartar.So, what do you use this tartar powder for? Often it’s added to baked goods to help activate baking soda to create rise. In fact, baking powder is just baking soda mixed with Cream of Tartar. A pinch can also be added to sugar before it’s cooked to prevent crystallization when making caramels or certain candies. It’s also extremely helpful when making macarons, pavlovas, floating islands or other dishes that use whipped egg whites as the powder stabilizes the air bubble matrix and keeps your meringue stiff.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Legend has it that the king of Portugal banned the import of cubeb berries from Java to bolster the sale of black pepper to better encourage trade relations with India and the rest of Europe. (Java had a monopoly on the spice as the spice was native to there. Spice merchants would sterilize the seeds to ensure they could not be grown on foreign soils.) This legend sprung from 17th century writer John Parkinson in his book, Theatrum Botanicum. Whether this is true is unknown. However, it might explain the reason why use of cubeb pepper died in the 16th century, giving rise to the proliferate use of black pepper in its place.A member of the pepper family, cubeb has a peppery, bitter, pungent flavor that’s tinged with a hint of allspice and nutmeg. It’s used in some Iraqi, Moroccan, Australian, and Middle Eastern cuisines and is the pepper of choice in Indonesia and Malaysia. In Europe and the Americas, Java black pepper is rarely seen or used in the kitchen. However, it is used extensively in cigarettes and gin. Cubeb pepper, these days, is the peppercorn of the hipster chef and home cook as this particular berry is still totally underground.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>There’s a reason you find ground cumin spice used in nearly every cuisine worldwide, why the Greeks used it for medicine, and why the Egyptians utilized it in the mummification process. Cumin is fragrant, nutritional, and makes everything taste utterly wonderful. (Except for mummies.)In fact, throughout history many spices were considered rare and unfathomably expensive, yet cumin was so beloved it made the rounds early.

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Also known as Prague Powder #1, pink curing salt is dyed to easily identify it from regular salt. The makeup is 6% sodium nitrite and 94% table salt. Sodium nitrate helps both to prevent the growth of bacteria (in particular, botulism) and to preserve the original color of the meat. Use 1 ounce of pink pickling salt for every 25 pounds of meat, as more may cause the meat to become overly salty and unpalatable.Prague powder #1 should not be used in place of table or seasoning salt. It is also not practical for long term curing projects such as salami.The name Prague powder could originate from the part of Europe where Poland, Germany, and the Czech Republic are. Prague also used to have major meat packing and meat curing districts. Theoretically, one could argue the colloquial name simply arose from its use in Prague.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Dutch-processing is a means of neutralizing acidity in cocoa by washing it in a potassium solution. The result is a mellower flavor, but also a much darker cocoa powder. In fact, this is a black cocoa, meaning we’ve done more dutching than a sidewalk jump rope crew. The flavor is extra intense and quite dark, so it can be paired with a lighter natural cocoa powder to get the perfect balance of flavor and color. Use our dark cocoa powder in baking in conjunction with baking powder as it has a higher level of acidity to activate the release of flavor and rise.Feel free to use this Dutch cocoa powder in any recipe that calls for dutch-processed cocoa. You can also substitute Dutch cocoa powder for natural cocoa in any sauce or ice cream, but not in baking.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

Nearly all of them use chocolate, chiles, salt, cloves, pepper, and cinnamon.Mole sauces are, naturally, the classic use for this particular blend. However, adding a pinch of it to baked beans, mixing it with butter and drowning a roasted cob of corn in it, adding it to brownies, or using it as a straight up rub are other great solutions. In addition, you can add a tablespoon of it to a bottle of vodka. Store this mole spice blend in a dark place for a week.

Panicked, the nuns prayed for guidance and, lo, the Lord guided them to just wing it with what they had. The nuns grabbed stale bread, cloves, chiles, salt, a few other spices and a bit of chocolate. They cooked it all into a sauce that they then braised a chicken in. The Archbishop adored it, and with that mole was born.</SPICE_INTRO>

        <SPICE_INTRO>Earl Grey tea was created as a way to imitate Chinese black teas that were flavored with mandarin. The British, not having direct access to mandarins, used oil from bergamots (another fragrant citrus fruit). It was actually a fraudulent product passed off as the real thing, the tea equivalent of buying an authentic Prada bag from the trunk of a car. However, Earl Grey soon became greatly appreciated for its own unique flavor and thus a new classic tea was born.</SPICE_INTRO>

The taste of dried enoki mushrooms has often been described as that of a green table grape with hints of radish. The soft cap is the most edible part and the crisp stalks offer a crunchy texture. (Though, like a stalk of asparagus, the oldest third of the stalk should be discarded, as it can be quite fibrous.So what to do with a wine-like broth and demurely radish-y cap? Add to hot and sour or egg drop soup in the last ten minutes of cooking to infuse the broth with a tickle of fruit flavor and for textural diversity. Add some golden needle mushrooms to salads and toss in a mirin-sesame oil-orange juice dressing. Better yet? Add to a stir-fry and you will be in for a serious treat as it just takes the flavor from here to HERE.Oh, and it’s healthy. Full of vitamins and it is said to help reduce blood pressure.

Many Vietnamese, Hmong, Laotian, and Indonesian recipes call for both as they have different flavors. Galangal has a ginger-ness to it, but it also had an intense floral sweetness, piney flavors, and a more penetrating spice with a hint of cinnamon.Whole galangal is fibrous and very hard, and is more so when dried. It can be added to soups or stews and fished out later. To use it otherwise you will need a strong spice grinder.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Garam masala translates from Hindi to “hot spice blend.” It’s not creative, but it is accurate. (Though, if you don’t speak Hindi it can be rather exotic sounding.) This garam masala seasoning blend is particularly popular in North Indian cuisine.“Garam” is the “hot” in “hot spice blend,” though this refers to the pungency of the mixture as opposed to the heat from cayenne pepper. Bitter, hot spices such as black pepper, black cardamom, cloves, turmeric, cinnamon and cumin make up the bulk of the garam masala spice mix.The blend is often the sole seasoning in many recipes though it can be one ingredient amongst many, particularly ginger and garlic. If you’re more a lazy weekend cook or you have a football game coming up, add this garam masala seasoning to bean dip or sour cream to make an interesting dip for chips.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

Its sweet, savory, sulfur-y flavor is intoxicating.To make this roasted garlic powder spice we take bulbs of garlic and slowly roast them until deeply caramelized and sticky. Once they smell savory, sweet, and addictive we dry them out and crush the cloves into a silky fine powder. If you don’t have the time to ready roasted garlic this is a fine stand-in. We’ve added this to marinades and rubs, but our favorite application is to fold it into cheddar-packed mornay sauces for mac and cheese. Another fave? A teaspoon of roasted garlic seasoning added to whipped potatoes, the kind where there isn’t a lump to be found and you’ve melted in an entire stick of butter because that’s the kind of thing that makes life worth living.Dare to be creative in the kitchen?

However, in small doses, it offers a very intriguing tingle that mixes beautifully in chili recipes, marmalades, and milk-based dishes and desserts.You should always wear gloves when using dried ghost peppers or ghost pepper powder. Thorough hand washing afterward is encouraged. Treat ghost pepper the way you would good wine: a little is just fine, while a lot will leave you suffering.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>A truly lavish name for what has historically been seen as a mere substitute. Grains of Paradise have gone by the geographically accurate name, Guinea pepper, and the more bestial moniker of alligator pepper. However, if you wanted to give it a name that reflected how most of the world has treated it then it should be called It’ll Do Pepper. It’s a shame considering how intriguing it is.When black pepper was truly the spice that defined the spice trade – and, to be frank, still does – Grains of Paradise began to be brought by caravan from Guinea and Ghana. It was used as a replacement spice when black pepper was unobtainable and cubeb berries were still a few centuries away from being a real competitor. It never really found a proper home, even amongst its native African origins. It is still used in West Africa, Ghana, and Guinea to some extent. Oddly enough, Scandinavia has an affinity for it, but only as a flavoring for akvavit.We say it’s a shame because Grains of Paradise are a rather intriguing spice if not for the inflated sense of self. They’re technically related to cardamom, but have more of a pepper flavor. Hot, pungent, and spicy but you’ll definitely notice a fruity-cardamom flavor. Yet it’s still rather timid amongst burlier flavors of actual black pepper and cardamom, and as such should be treated as a subtle pepper or a baking spice.Today, Grains of Paradise are popular in spice blends and for flavoring alcohol. A growing number of people are now beginning to substitute it for pepper in numerous preparations. If you’re into home brewing then this is a godsend. It won’t overpower your brews with a kick in the shin of spice and is easier to control. In addition, alcohol has a fine way of bringing out the wilder flavors of Grains of Paradise seasoning.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Made from the unripe drupes that are used for black and white pepper, green peppercorns are young and immature when picked. Sulfur dioxide, freeze drying, pickling, or canning methods are used in order to preserve the green color that otherwise oxidizes and turns brown. In the regions where peppercorn vines can grow, fresh green berries are often added to dishes as a garnish or as an ingredient to curry pastes.Dehydrated green peppercorns are easy substituted for peppercorns in brine, or pickled peppercorns, by re-hydrating them in liquid one hour before use. Warm water works well, but wine, broth, or any other liquid can just as easily be used.This whole green pepper has a uniform light-green color with the characteristic aroma and pungent flavor of fresh green pepper. The aroma is somewhat piney, even with hints of resin and camphor. There are small squeaks of hoppiness that one might normally associate with beer. (A good enough excuse to use green peppercorn when beer braising meats.) The flavor isn’t as spicy as black pepper, nor as pungent. Instead, it’s fresh, perky, and piquant. Whole green peppercorns make for an excellent addition to poultry, fish, vegetable, and milder game meats. Green peppercorns go especially well with very fresh or fruity tasting foods. Try them ground on salads, steamed vegetables, salsas, and in sauces.Green Peppercorn Cooking HintsThis kind of immature pepper can easily be crushed just before use, between two spoons or even your fingers.Green peppercorns complement game and duck dishes, terrines, creamy sauces and in vinaigrette.French, Creole, and Thai cuisine are well-known for their use of green peppercorns.Substitute green pepper in dishes that have lively and fresh flavors.Dehydrated green peppercorns are easy substituted for peppercorns in brine by re-hydrating them in liquid one hour before use.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

In fact, most of the green tea people drink generally tends to be Chun Mee (albeit usually made up of low-quality fannings and dust).Chun Mee has a pleasant chestnut aroma and the taste is complex, akin to sweetened chestnuts, artichoke, and apricot. The whole of it is a bit bitter, with a slightly sweet finish. Chun Mee is a quiet and easygoing tea leaf that loves to be bottled up and taken to yoga practice or the office.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>A green tea for those who feel they’ve tasted all other green teas. A colloquial name for this tea is Lucky Dragon Tea. Hyson tea from the Anhui province of China is actually considered a rather low-grade tea. However, those young buds plucked before the rainy season are considered to be particularly flavorful. The leaves are twisted into long, whisker-thin rolls that unfurl like tiny scrolls when steeped.The cup pours a pale yellow-green color similar to impure beryl. The flavor is full-bodied and strong with a piney finish that some casual tea drinkers may find off-putting at first, but that the connoisseur will find fascinating. It is this piney flavor that makes this tea perfect to drink alongside cold meat dishes or salty snacks.A little history note, it is estimated that about 15-20% of the tea tossed in the harbor at the Boston Tea Party was Hyson tea.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

The root and leaves of the sassafras tree were used by Native Choctaw Indians before also being incorporated as part of the motley blend that is Creole cooking.The flavor is similar to root beer (the flavor of which comes from sassafras root) and has woodsy, rosemary-like notes to it. Sassafras powder is often used as a thickener more than a flavoring agent. This is particularly true for gumbo, a traditional Creole dish. When in season, okra is used to thicken gumbo and filé powder is used when it isn’t.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Harissa is a spice blend that comes in powdered, paste and liquid forms. Harissa is sourced from Tunisia, which is the very northern country on the African continent. Bordering the Mediterranean sea, Tunisia has a rich culinary history that takes inspiration from Morocco, Italy, France, Spain, Greece, and Egypt.Harissa powder seasoning is the child of the many spice trades that passed through Tunisia. It’s rare you’ll find such a unique blend of spices that take inspiration from so many corners of the globe. Caraway, sumac, cumin, coriander, garlic, vinegar powder, paprika, and numerous varieties of chilies… it all blends together so elegantly. Flavors are balanced so well you could put it on a scale.The harissa spice blend by itself makes for a fantastic rub, but it also works as a wet rub, marinade, or dipping sauce when whisked with a bit of olive oil and vinegar. Chefs in France and Germany are utilizing it in aioli for aromatic dips and spreads. Bakers in the Middle East give flatbreads a bit of pop with a delicate dusting of this brick red powder. Israeli falafel vendors keep harissa in shakers for customers to spice up their meals. Our harissa powder seasoning is an amazing all-purpose blend if there ever was one.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

Brewed with hot water this tisane has been consumed for thousands of years in South Africa and it’s neighboring countries, and was an important item of trade throughout the continent.Rooibos steeped with the flavor of chocolate from real chocolate chips makes for an indulgent and bittersweet cup of herbal chocolate chai tea. However, we took it a few steps further: the smooth flavor is interrupted by tingling jolts of ginger and cardamom for a sensual and – dare we say – sexy cup.Another intriguing application is to pop a teaspoon of this loose leaf Chai tea into maple syrup. Microwave for about 20-30 seconds and allow to sit for about 5 minutes. Strain and enjoy your chocolate-chai maple syrup over a stack of pancakes.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

Add at the start of cooking for any slow cooking recipes, or quickly add to a bit of cooking oil before sautéing vegetables so that the essential oils can release adequately.A curious note: lavender is only present in American versions of Herbs de Provence and is rarely added within France.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Hibiscus flower also goes by the name jamaica, sorrel, chai torsh, bissap, and many others. From Iran to Mexico to Tobago this crimson blossom has a serious fan following. Hibiscus flowers are a sort of miracle plant. The leaves are used to make healing compounds. The seeds have diuretic properties. The fibrous stems are used to make burlap. And the sepals – the fleshy par that holds the flower – are used for food coloring and for tisanes.It’s the tisane part we’re interested in, of course. The flavor of hibiscus is very cranberry-like with an added floral quality to it. Often citrus juice or other fruit juices are added, sometimes black tea, and almost always a sweetener is stirred in to offset the tartness.Powdered hibiscus makes for a quick tea. Add hot water or green tea, give it a shake and a bit of sugar, pour it in a bottle and go. Instant agua de jamaica. For a more confectionary application roll homemade chocolate truffles in hibiscus powder as opposed to cocoa powder for sweet-tart treats with a broody pink complexion. For the jam maker, a teaspoon of hibiscus powder added to stone fruit or berry jams adds complexity and a pleasant tart tang.NOTE: In the inspection and processing of a 14,000 lb. shipment of conventional hibiscus our supplier received in February 2021, they discovered about a dozen peanut shell remnants (each less than 1/2 inch in size) which would equate to finding a total of 4 or 5 peanut shells (not actual peanuts, but shells) in 14,000 pounds of product received. This is due to the common practice of intercropping hibiscus and peanuts. While the incidence of peanut shell remnants appears to be very low, we wanted to make our customers aware of this slight possibility.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

This can come from a simple pat of butter and a good grind of black pepper, or for a little flare perhaps using some of the hickory steak seasoning blend. Coarsely ground sea salt, paprika, garlic, onion, a good dose of sugar, and some hickory smoke flavor give this a rounded sweet-and-salty flavor with a whisper of smoke.For camping, we also love to rub this steak seasoning blend over whole potatoes with a bit of oil, wrap them up in foil, and tuck in the campfire for about an hour. It may damn well be some of the best camping food you’ll ever eat.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

Dried honey powder can be added to coffee or tea with ease and works wonders in a steamy bowl of oatmeal.Honey powder also acts as an instant glaze for meats. Sprinkle it over a roasted pork loin, ham, or chicken ten minutes before the cooking is done. A sweet, crackly glaze will form over the meat, sealing in juices as it rests. For the grill master, season a rack of ribs with salt, black pepper, chili powder, and powdered honey for a recipe that’ll make more than one appearance during the summer.Liquid honey doesn’t do well in baking. Ask any baker and they’ll say how it browns easily and makes scrumptious desserts look completely burnt. Honey powder is novel solution in that it doesn’t brown as much and leaves cakes golden in color.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Granulated honey is honey that has been dried and ground. The honey retains the same flavor but has a crunchy quality to it. Furthermore, it dissolves well in liquid, but doesn’t have the stickiness of fresh honey.Granulated honey is a used for vinaigrettes, sauces, marinades, and brines. However, bakers and candy makers are the ones who most often use it. Granulated honey is a way to imbue a honey flavor without working with honey directly (which is persnickety, burns easily, and browns into a dark unpleasant color when heated).</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Horseradish has been used for culinary purposes as far back as 1500 BC where ancient Egyptian tomes speak of a pungent root. Horseradish had made its way from the far frozen northlands of Eurasia where Serbian tribes roamed far before anything like Russia or even Keivan Rus’ (Russia’s ancient predecessor) existed.Horseradish root is pungent, hot, acrid, and very mustard-like. Indeed, when fresh it can cause the eyes to water and the nose to run. Horseradish was believed by many culture to ease sore joints, remedy colds, and functioned as an aphrodisiac (likely due to the fact that its pungency causes sweating and increased heart rate, similar to what you might experience when you talked to your secret crush in high school).In food, dried horseradish root powder is commonly used as a rub for beef or added to hamburger. It is sometimes utilized as a substitute for wasabi powder. Powdered horseradish has been added to sauces for oysters, but we find this easily knocks out the briny flavor of the oysters themselves.For a simple horseradish sauce, combine 1 1/2 parts water, 1 part horseradish powder, and ½ part lemon juice. Use it over steaks for the best effect. For a jaunty brunch application, add a pinch of powdered horseradish to a Bloody Mary.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

Mediterranean and North American herbs were carefully picked and balanced with green tea for a soothing cup. Unlike traditional chai, which has a very spicy and bold approach, Immortalitea is more muted. If chai is an entire percussion section, then green chai is a master musician playing the flute.The overall effect might be thought to be overly herbal, even medicine-y.

The flavor is strong and packed with a full-bodied, even somewhat bready flavor. Most often served with milk and a bit of sugar this tea is usually had at breakfast, but is often consumed at any time of day. Strangely enough, the highest consumer of most Irish Breakfast teas isn’t Ireland, but the United States.A popular use for Irish Breakfast tea for students is in oatmeal cookies. The ingredients are cheap, plus and the sugar and caffeine make the cookies the ultimate late night study tool. Just add a teaspoon of ground Irish Breakfast tea leaves to the flour and make the cookies as usual. They’ll take on a slightly malty flavor and keep you abuzz well into the wee hours.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Jerk seasoning is popular in Jamaican and Caribbean cuisine and refers to the preparation of meat with an earthy, spicy dry or wet rub. The Jamaican jerk dry rub is a strange mix that has a dark history. Unquestionably, jerk seasoning began as an African spice rub that was adapted by slaves transported throughout the Caribbean. As various peoples and nationalities travelled through the Atlantic the recipe changed with spices like thyme, nutmeg, and cloves being added. Heat increased dramatically when people began to add Scotch Bonnet peppers in lieu of tamer chiles.We classify our Jamaican jerk seasoning from our dry jerk seasoning in that this one has a lot of chile pepper blended in. If you're looking for something with a bit of ground scotch bonnet, plenty of paprika, and a hefty dose of cayenne, then this will scorch your tongue into a cinder just fine.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Japanese curries are often milder, sweeter, and with more focus on savory flavors than heat. Japanese cuisine doesn’t have a lot of focus on complex spice blends; so when Japan began to adopt curry powder from India into its cuisine, much of the cumin, cayenne, ginger, and black pepper was reduced. The result is a clean-tasting Japanese yellow curry powder with a focus on ginger and turmeric flavors.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

It’s a hardy, easy to grow variety that offers beauty in big green leaves and chilies that range from burnt red or daffodil yellow. They also allow every home a chance to dry and stock up these chilies in bulk for oils, sauces, and spice blends.The chile itself is vegetal in flavor and is used for its raw, uncaged heat. Added to stir-frys, infused into vodka or cooking oil, or crushed with fleur de sel into a flavored salt this chile enjoys dancing on your lips and the tip of your tongue unleashing a passion that stirs the soul. A perfect chile for date night cooking if you can get past a bit of Japones-induced sniffling.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Scented green teas go as far back as the Song Dynasty (960 AD -1279 AD). This was a period of great technological, economic, political, and culinary achievements. The Song Dynasty saw the invention of the compass and the establishment of true north, the creation of gunpowder warfare, the first banknotes, and moveable type. Food-wise the Song Dynasty saw the spread of imported exotic produce such as jujubes, the proliferation of noodle shops, and the development of a wide array of scented green teas.Scented green teas were generally reserved for the Imperial court, though other high ranking and wealthy families were able to indulge in them. Green teas were placed in containers with powerful aromatics such as tangerine peel or cassia bark and allowed to absorb their flavor. One of the most prized scented teas was (and still is) jasmine. Jasmine blossoms are plucked at night when closed and then placed in containers of green tea. In the morning when the blossoms open they release their perfume, which is then absorbed by the tea leave. This can be repeated dozens of times.This basic green tea has been lightly scented and makes for a perfect anytime tea that brews easy and matches salty snacks, Chinese food, vegetable soups, fruit tarts, and chocolate cakes.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Juniper berries are sourced from an evergreen shrub that grows in Northern, rather chilly climates and some temperate climates. It has been used for centuries as a table spice and an ingredient for marinades, spirits, and as a preservative by ancient Romans, Gauls, the French, and many Native American tribes. (The latter also used the berries as beads for jewelry and decoration.) Many cultures also thought the berries to have mystical properties such as the ability to purify dwellings or the body.The flavor is piney, sweet, woody, fresh and will definitely remind you of gin. The spice is popular mainly for pickling and for the production of gin and other spirits. However, the berry’s flavor works well for meat rubs. Blend with salt, garlic, and black pepper for a popular dry rub that goes well with venison, boar, and lamb. Finely ground with thyme and rosemary, the rub features well on less fatty cuts of beef.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

To see a pale violet ocean, infinite in every direction, rippling in the wind is astounding. The air is floral with hints of citrus, camphor, lilac, and mint.Used in perfumes, soaps, and essential oils, dried lavender has long been prized for its aroma (and affordability). One must be judicious as the dried lavender for cooking can be rather potent. Using too much will cause a dish to go from flavored to soapy. Add culinary lavender to fruit crumble or pies or infuse into cream and simple syrups. Pairs wonderfully with berries, rhubarb, cream, lemon, and grapes.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Lemon juice has been used to make this pale, beach-colored powder. Cooks and bakers reading this, we bet you’re rolling your eyes. Lemon juice powder?! Pshaw! Why bother when lemon zest is so fresh?! So bright! So clean in flavor! Well, naysayers, lemon zest is all aromatic oil and no citric acid.Sure you can use straight up citric acid, but that’s a bit chemical, isn’t it? This lemon concentrate powder possesses high levels of citric acid as well as lemon oil. Combined with fresh lemon zest you’ll have all the sweet and sour. In regards to baking this has less acid that straight up lemon juice and won’t muck up the pH balance of your carefully structured recipes.If you’re more of a laid back baker try this. Add a ½ teaspoon of lemon powder seasoning to your pie or biscuit dough or add to the flour you use to coat a loaf of bread before baking. That sour smack breathes fresh air into a stale recipe.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

Rather this herbal infusion effuses lemon via lemon balm, lemon verbena, and lemongrass; three very citrusy herbs that offer depth to contrast with the peppermint and spearmint.

After that we add heaps of sugar, some more water, and then serve it over ice. (And then fresh lemon, because we’re persnickety like that.)</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_CUISINE>Asian, Indonesian, Malaysian, Southeast Asia, Thai, Vietnamese</SPICE_CUISINE>
        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>This tropical grass is native to Southeast Asia, but has become a popular garden herb and landscaping plant in temperate climates such as the Mediterranean and California. The sharp, slender leaves aren’t of much use, but the fibrous bulb is incredibly aromatic. Bruise it up and the volatile oils emerge from the verdant slumber with a clean, perky smell of lemon and lime.Lemongrass is too fibrous to be edible unless minced very finely, but mincing can be rather tedious when it comes to these sturdy stalks. Instead, ground lemongrass offers the flavor without the busting, bruising, and fishing out. (Nothing upsets a curry experience like chomping into a stalk of lemongrass.) Buy lemongrass powder and liberally apply it both at the beginning of a soup or stock to build flavor, and at the end to release fresh the aromatics. In addition, it’s a quirky spice to rub on pork ribs, scallops, or chicken breasts.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>It isn’t really hard to guess why the lobster mushroom is so named. This parasitic fungus (it’s not technically a mushroom) grows on other mushrooms and eventually colonizes them with a meaty, red flesh that takes on the appearance of cooked lobster meat. In the process the zombified mushroom host gains both a striking appearance and delightful flavor.The aroma when dried lobster mushroom reconstitutes, strangely, is a little aquatic and somewhat reminiscent of shellfish. The flavor makes the name even more appropriate as there are faint hints of lobster and certainly a taste of clam amongst its otherwise simple mushroom flavor. Use it in place of nearly any mushroom in a recipe. This cooking lobster mushroom for sale is a perfect addition to casseroles or plates of mac and cheese.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>If you crack open the fruit that the nutmeg kernel grows in, you’ll find around that kernel a lacy, apricot-colored webbing called the aril. This is the second spice to nutmeg that we call mace. This spice was vastly important in European trade routes, particularly that of the Dutch. While it can grow in India and parts of Asia, nearly half of the world’s crop is grown on the tiny, island commonwealth country of Grenada.Mace is the sophisticated older sister to nutmeg. It has a sprightly, warm flavor reminiscent of nutmeg, but you’ll notice that it’s significantly stronger. The delicate aril also boasts potent citric, clove, and floral aromas that permeate a dish and have all the subtlety of a kick to the shin. The sweetness finishes with a strong bitter note that rings in your mouth for a while, so mace is best tempered with other spices and a bit of sugar.Cooking with Ground MaceMace like nutmeg is used to flavor cakes and other sweets, but mace is also used in many savory dishes. These include meats, sauces, curries, pickling, ketchup, and even Worcestershire sauce. Mace enjoys being used in high fat foods. Mornay sauces, hot chocolate, soufflés, and puddings all benefit from mace’s unique flavor profile.Mace can be used as a nutmeg substitute in most recipes. This spice is sweeter and milder, but has a similar flavor to nutmeg. Mace is often used in place of nutmeg when dark colored flecks of nutmeg might ruin the appearance of certain dishes. Ground mace seasoning can be substituted in light colored sauces, clear broths, omelets, and mashed potatoes. Our Mace powder is ground from whole mace spice to release its essential oils, flavor, &amp; aroma. Mace should be added at the begin of the cooking process to allow its full flavor to come out.Mace (Nutmeg) TreeMace is produced by the Myristica franrans, a member of the mayriticaceae family. This plant, native to Indonesia, grows into a tropical evergreen tree of up to 30 feet tall. This same tree produces the better known nutmeg spice.The seed of this tree, which we know as nutmeg, is encased in several edible layers. The outer most is a small, golden colored fruit with reddish spots. The next layer is a red, web like, seed membrane called an aril, which is sold as the spice mace. The mace aril encapsulates the endosperm, or nutmeg seed.Fresh nutmeg mace has a bright red color which, turning dark-orange to brown when dried.The leave of these trees are long dark green, and oblong. Its small white flowers form in clusters at the ends of the branches.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

This gives the finished product a full body impact and a remarkable after taste.We offer this premium extract in both single-fold or double-fold solutions. Our 2-Fold extracts are made with twice the amount of beans used for the same volume of single-fold extract.

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Marjoram is a perennial plant that is very closely related to oregano. The flavor is warm, spicy, herbal, and a tad bitter the way oregano is, but a bit sweeter with a mystery of mint to it. Used throughout Mediterranean and Italian cooking, its persnickety oils don’t make it a good candidate for prolonged cooking methods. Sweet marjoram spice should always be added at the very end of cooking to ensure the flavor is at its strongest. Dried marjoram has a stronger flavor than fresh and is usually preferred for this reason.Dried marjoram seasoning is used in sauces, stuffing, and often in salad dressings. It also has been used in cheese making where the dried leaves are used to coat the rind and infuse the milk as it ages.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

When the Matsutake began to finally recover from over-harvesting a nematode infestation then took them back into being quite endangered. As of today, high-quality wild Matsutake can go for thousands of dollars. In response, the Matsutake is now being responsibly farmed around the world to make the peppery mushroom more available.The best possible way to prepare dried Matsutake mushrooms is on the grill. Marinate them in teriyaki, hoisin, or a bit of sherry vinegar for about 30-40 minutes. Afterwards, grill them until they lose much of their body and water. Eat them straight or serve them on top of salads, rolled into sushi, or add to pizzas.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Molasses is a viscous by-product of the sugar refining process. Sugar cane is crushed and the juice is boiled over and over. The result actually has a low sugar content, but high mineral and vitamin content. The robust flavor and syrupy texture makes it a perfect addition to gingerbread, molasses cake, and barbeque sauces.Granulated molasses is a novel way to perk up spice rubs and breads, but also work as a unique garnish to frosted cakes, homemade caramels, or sprinkled over ganache-covered candies.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Mushroom hunters search high and low for true Morels, and a lucky few have secret spots where they know a bounty will grow every year. Try asking any hunter where their spot is and you’ll be greeted with silence. No mushroom hunter will ever give up dried morel mushrooms.It’s understandable. Dried morel mushrooms have a delicate flavor that only lingers around for a short while. It’s gone the moment you swallow.Chewing is another matter. The flavor is mighty when chewing. It’s a mushroom that’s truly worth the hunt. However, some home gardeners get lucky. It’s not unheard of to buy woodchips for a garden and then after a rain find little armies of Morels springing up.These dried morel mushrooms are great for our sautéed morel mushroom recipe. You can add a bit of salt and cracked pepper for a classic preparation or toss with pasta and serve in a cream sauce with generous shavings of Parmesan.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>This mushroom should also be known as the From Death mushroom or the Phoenix mushroom. The reason for this is that when rehydrated, a dried Mousseron can begin producing spores again due to the presence of mycose, a unique sugar found in mushrooms. When wet the cells that were stuck in a sort of suspended animation digest the sugar and come back to life.This mycose is also what gives the mushroom its musty and sweet flavor. The sugar content is so high it’s not unheard of for this mushroom to be used in baked goods and bread. Grinding them up and adding them to a banana bread is a novel approach. Of course, sautéing them and using them to top some fresh polenta is a rather fine idea, too.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Mulato chiles are, like ancho chiles, a dried poblano pepper. However, the poblano in this case is allowed to mature on the plant until it turns bright red. The resulting pepper is much spicier in flavor. When dried into its mulato form, these dried poblano peppers are much more bitter with a more intense flavor of raisins.These whole mulato chiles are considered a must-have ingredient for authentic moles and make any chile con carne far more intriguing.

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Ground from white mustard seeds – which are actually tawnier in appearance – this mustard spice isn’t as sharp as mustard powders ground from black or brown mustard seeds. Unlike many dry mustard powders on the market, Spice Jungle’s isn’t neon yellow. This is because many low-grade brands add small amounts of turmeric to create a more vivid color, but this can affect the overall flavor.Whole seeds have little aroma, and have to be ground for the flavors to awaken. The enzyme myrosinase is what gives mustard its acrid pungency and penetrating heat. However, it’s a fickle enzyme. Water must be added for the enzyme’s flavor to bloom and temperature matters. Cold water will ensure a mustard paste that is intensely hot, bitter, acrid, and pungent (possibly to the point of it being inedible if the water is ice cold). Warm water will mellow it out and hot water will negate the flavor all together.To make it at home, mix ground mustard spice with some slightly cooler than warm temperature water, a bit of honey and chilled white wine. It should all be of a sauce-like consistency. When the myrosinase is first activated it’ll be too brash to be eaten right away (give it a taste and see). Place in a sealed jar in the fridge for two or three days before using.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Black mustard seeds are amongst the top mainstay spices used in Indian cooking. When soaked in water the myrosinase is activated and the dish will benefit from an intense heat and pungency. A trick, though, is to heat or toast the seeds in hot oil or ghee instead. The nutty flavors are achieved with none of the acridness. Myrosinase dissipates quickly when heated so it should be added towards the end of cooking if it’s been ground into powder.Mustard seeds come in three varieties: yellow, brown, and black. Yellow mustard seeds (also called white mustard seeds since the sandy color can go either way) are used primarily in Europe and western Asia, whereas brown and black are used in India and the countries surrounding it.Flavor-wise they all differ greatly. Yellow seeds are mellow with less pungency, and have an initial floral sweetness to them. Brown seeds are a bit horseradish-y with an earthy flavor (though sometimes possess enough heat to burn down a barn). Black seeds are particularly pungent and hot, the impact of biting into one is enough to bring about a nuclear winter.Whole seeds have little aroma, and have to be ground for the flavors to awaken.

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Nigella is the botanical name for love-in-the-mist flowers, a popular garden plant with large, sky blue petals and lacy foliage. However, the black seeds used for culinary purposes come from a less grandiose species with petals more cream colored and fewer in number. (It’s rather blah to be honest.)The seeds of this plant are called nigella, black caraway, and kalonji, though are sometimes misnamed as black onion seed. The seeds are tiny as pinpricks and carbon colored. Popular in India, West Bengal, and Bangladesh they’re rarely consumed outside of these countries. The seeds are often sold whole as grinding them releases its volatile oils which degrade quickly. While added to spice mixtures, the seeds are often used whole as a garnish for breads and curries. The seeds are also mixed with salt and used to flavor legume, grain, potato, and vegetable dishes before cooking.While their crunchy texture is lovely it is their unique-to-the-spice-world flavor that makes them so darn keen. Subtle to be sure, but salt and starches bring out their nutty-earthy flavor. The aroma is uniquely yeasty and bready, with hints of oregano.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>If the nora chile was a person it would be a squat, somewhat overweight summer camp leader with a relaxed demeanor and motherly tendencies. She has a hearty laugh and totally endearing, but could do with a shower as she smells from the dry heat and campfire smoke.The flavor is subtle and earthy. Nora chiles pairs well with meats, fish, root veggies, and savory sauces. If you want to go the Spanish route then add it to homemade chorizo, shrimp ceviche, or a seafood paella. The best piece of advice we have? Toast a nora chile and crush it into chile flakes. Afterwards, keep it in an airtight container at the table and use it the same way you might use black pepper at the table (i.e. on everything). It’ll transform the everyday meal into a small Spanish celebration.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Nutmeg comes from an evergreen tree native to the Spice Islands near Indonesia, but has been cultivated throughout the tropics by both native cultures and foreign. Not only did native cultures find use for them in cuisine and medicine, nutmeg caused a fervor for the English, Dutch, Chinese, Indians, and pretty much anyone else who came in contact with it.Nutmeg is the nut from the Myristica fragrans tree. The fruit surrounding the nut is often candied or turned into preserves, or juiced and turned into a “nutmeg” syrup. The aril around the nutmeg is the spice we call mace. Nutmeg, however, is the primary harvest.Ground nutmeg is used when whole nutmeg is unavailable, or when you need copious amounts of it. Add to cream sauces, braises, pilafs, cakes, or near anything else.A note: Nutmeg contains myristicin, a substance with psychoactive properties, but that also is used to treat depression. While toxic in large quantities, it would require a person to consume many tablespoons of ground nutmeg for it to become so. In the tiny quantities used for cooking, nutmeg is perfectly harmless.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Popular in Indian and Bengali dishes, the name panch phoron literally means “five spices.” The mixture consists of five seeds: cumin, fenugreek, fennel, black mustard, and nigella. The mixture is often dry-toasted in a hot pan or lightly fried in ghee or oil to bring out the flavors. Afterwards, vegetables or starches are added, then stir-fried or roasted. The mixture is also used as a topping for bread or at times added to lentil dishes. Modern chefs have branched out using this traditionally vegetarian-focused spice blend and using it on pork and game birds. We love to add it to pizzas topped with spinach and white bean purée before they get popped in the oven.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Premium paprika 120-140 ASTA, sounds rather scientific. ASTA stands for the American Spice Trade Association, a group founded in 1907 that represents spice producers, brokers, growers, dehydrators, traders and so on. The ASTA number simply refers to the brightness of the red color and is a means of classification (which, as we’ve discussed, is quite needed for paprika). 120-140 is bright red paprika that has a slightly smoky, very sweet smell with bitter notes at the back. This is the paprika seasoning of choice for everyday cooking and for when the dish needs seriously bright red color.If there was any spice with a more complicated history or confusing categorization, it must be paprika. Paprika is made from the Capsicum annuum plant, which sounds simple enough. However, there are dozens of varieties of this pepper - both chile and bell. Yet, genetically, they’re all the same species. (Think of it in the way all people are human, but look very different from each other.)Paprika spice is technically native to North and Central America and was used by the indigenous peoples as a food and as a coloring agent. Spanish explorers became enamored with the plant and brought it back to Spain along with tomatoes, potatoes, and other produce. The Spanish – particularly the lower classes, as the heat of paprika was considered undignified by the rich – began using the seeds in food preparation.The seeds spread past Iberia to Turkey and throughout the Ottoman Empire, as well as throughout Europe to the Balkan countries and Russia. Later on it became endeared by India and the Middle East. And, of course, each country began breeding it to their tastes; the Spanish by smoking it, the Turks preferring hotter varieties, and the Hungarians loved it sweet and mild.

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Paprika, 85-100 ASTA, sounds rather scientific. ASTA stands for the American Spice Trade Association, a group founded in 1907 that represents spice producers, brokers, growers, dehydrators, traders and so on. The ASTA number simply refers to the brightness of the red color and is a means of classification (which, as we’ve discussed, is quite needed for paprika). 90 is a dust red with the smell of ancient earth and cold cave stone – an unlikely flavor for paprika. Use when you want a ruddy color and you need a paprika that offers background support to other prominent spices.If there was any spice with a more complicated history or confusing categorization, it must be paprika. Paprika is made from the Capsicum annuum plant, which sounds simple enough. However, there are dozens of varieties of this pepper - both chile and bell. Yet, genetically, they’re all the same species. (Think of it in the way all people are human, but look very different from each other.)Paprika is technically native to North and Central America and was used by the indigenous peoples as a food and as a coloring agent. Spanish explorers became enamored with the plant and brought it back to Spain along with tomatoes, potatoes, and other produce. The Spanish – particularly the lower classes, as the heat of paprika was considered undignified by the rich – began using the seeds in food preparation.The seeds spread past Iberia to Turkey and throughout the Ottoman Empire, as well as throughout Europe to the Balkan countries and Russia. Later on, it became endeared by India and the Middle East. And, of course, each country began breeding it to their tastes; the Spanish by smoking it, the Turks preferring hotter varieties, and the Hungarians loved it sweet and mild. Hungary and Spain, however, are the major producers of paprika, with the United States as a distant third.Thus, we have endless varieties of paprika. Whew.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Peppermint is arguably the matriarch of the mint family, which is a bit odd as peppermint is technically a hybrid of spearmint and watermint. Peppermint escaped into the wild millenniums ago and now grows wild in North America and Europe, though it needs to grow close to its parent species, as it cannot reproduce with other peppermint plants.Peppermint has a penetrating flavor and cooling effect that is widely used in sauces for lamb and game, and is often steeped in cream and milk for various desserts.

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Sure, dried Pequin chiles are so hot that they can be used as fuel to shoot off model rockets, but they have flavor! It’s citrusy with hints of mesquite and smoke, and backing it all up is a very solid cooked red bell pepper flavor. It’s a wonderful thing for the tongue to behold before it’s incinerated into a carbon slab.So, what do you do with dried Pequin peppers? You make homemade hot sauce, of course. Take a good handful of chiles, a few cloves of garlic, ½ of water, 1 cup of cider vinegar, and a toasted and reconstituted guajillo chile and give it all a good whirl in your blender until liquefied. Pass through a fine mesh strainer in a large, wide baking dish (to get the air out of the sauce). Let the mixture sit for an hour and then bottle it up. It’ll keep in the fridge for 6 months.You’re welcome.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

Another way to add the whole peppercorn flavoring is to place them in a cheese cloth bag and let simmer in a stew or soup, remove the bag before serving.

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Instead of coming from the vine that black, white, and green pepper is sourced from, pink peppercorns are the berries of Peruvian pepper tree that grows throughout South America, but often is grown throughout suburban North America. The slight peppery flavor is due to piperine oil, which is also found in other peppercorns. However, the heat of other peppers isn’t present here.The flavor of pink peppercorns is rather fruity, though like an academic text, read into it enough and you’ll come to rather fascinating footnotes - pine, juniper berry, and a vague sort of berry aroma exist.The berries have a chemical that can cause stomach irritation, but only when consumed in enormous quantities. You’ll never need as much pink pepper as you would black, white, or green as pink peppercorns can be a bit more abrasive. Due to their piercing quality, they compliment fatty meats, fishes, and sauces well. In addition, they work well when paired with chocolate.Pink pepper is also an ingredient in some Chilean wines and has numerous medical properties.The Pink Peppercorn Plant:These are not true "peppercorns", but similar tasting berries often called Pink Peppercorns, Peruvian pink pepper, Baies Rose Plant, or Peppertree (Schinus molle) that is native to South America.The Baies Rose plant is a small tree that has numerous compound leaves with slender, symmetrical, leaflets on each side of the leaf.The peppercorns form in clusters on the tips of the branches and can be from white, at an immature age, to pink or even a dark red. Like its cousin the mango (Anacardiaceae family), this plant can also cause allergies.Schinus terebinthifolius, or the Brazilian peppertree, is a closely related species whose berries are also sold as pink peppercorns in some areas. This pink pepper plant, like Sch. molle, is also a small tree when fully grown. The biggest difference between it and Sch. molle is their compound leaves. The Leaves of Sch. terebinthifolius have fewer leaflets and they are more stubby and rounded, the veins on the leaves are also light green. It has an appearance similar to that of holly and is sometimes used as a substitute for it. Schinus terebinthifolius grows wildly in only a couple of parts of the United States, mostly low lying areas with plentiful water such as wetlands. The branches of this sort of tree intertwine to form a thick barrier that blocks light from reaching surrounding plants. Its berries are almost identical to that of its close relative Schinus molle.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>The opium poppy is the very same poppy that gives us the delicious seeds we use in muffins and vinaigrettes. Its scientific name, Papafer somniferum, means “sleep-inducing poppy,” which comes from the poppy seed pod’s latex that is around 12% morphine. (If you’ve never put it together before, this is why it’s a field of poppies that put poor Dorothy Gale and her companions to sleep.)While the opium-rich latex within the poppy possesses high levels of narcotics, the actual seeds do not. The seeds have a long rich history and were never harvested for themselves, but as a byproduct of opium production.The flavor is somewhat nutty and even a bit citric, and their pinprick crunch is highly valued in baked goods. Blue poppy seeds are produced throughout Europe and possess a distinct almond flavor as opposed to the mellower taste of white and brown poppy seeds.Poppy seeds for baking must be toasted or baked before their flavor to be at their peak. Due to their high oil and protein content bulk poppy seeds tend to go rancid quickly so be sure to purchase them in small quantities. Store poppy seeds for baking in an airtight container in a dark and dry place, but toss after six months.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

Brewed with hot water this tisane has been consumed for thousands of years in South Africa and it’s neighboring countries, and was an important item of trade throughout the continent.Today, the Rooibos red bush tea is often enjoyed much the safe way black tea or coffee is, with cream and sugar. However, rooibos is finding a modern preparation via the red espresso. Rooibos is ground to a fine powder and processed as espresso powder would be. The result is a much richer, more intense, dark red brew. In addition, many people enjoy brewing these rooibos tea leaves in milk as opposed to water and sweetening it with vanilla and simple syrup.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

The texture when reconstituted is crunchy, meaning it will hold up well to grilling and functions well in chunky sauces.When fresh, the saffron milk cap is often pickled. Dried, it can be used as a flavoring agent for other pickles such as fish, eggs, or cauliflower.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Dalmatian sage comes from Dalmatia, a region in Croatia near the eastern part of the Adriatic Sea. The popular dog breed actually received its name from this region, as did this particularly potent strain of sage. This evergreen shrub is considered to be at its strongest in aroma, medicinal properties, hardiness, and flavor when grown in Croatia’s unique terroir.Dalmatian Sage has a quirky seat in the American kitchen. Many people have it in their cupboards or grow it in their gardens, but few ever actually use it. It’s like the good china you save for the special occasion that never comes. Sage pairs well with proteins and strongly scented foods; eggs (shirred eggs), pineapple (add to upside down cakes), lamb (in lamb burgers), chicken (stuff in the cavity), onions (in stuffing), and breads (in pumpkin muffins). Once you experiment a bit you’ll find it to be a versatile herb whose willowy, sweet, somewhat mint-savory-parsley-like flavor can be added to numerous recipes.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>For a while the Scorpion Pepper held the world’s record with Guinness as “The World’s Hottest Pepper.” (A title taken away by the Naga Viper chile, whose crown was soon usurped by the Ghost Pepper.) Chefs who cook with Scorpion Peppers are required to wear gloves, eyewear, and masks as the fumes can induce burning and numbness. Clocking in at near 1,500,000 Scoville units these peppers are no joke.The name comes from both the spicy sting of these peppers and because the peppers look like a scorpion’s telson (stinger), growing gnarled and bulbous before tapering off sharply into a curved tip. These are bright red and fiercely potent. As a rather curious contrast the flavor is extremely floral, often described as being reminiscent of rose and geranium.Looking for cooking ideas for the scorpion pepper? Add one of these to a batch of refried beans, grind a bit up into Scorpion Powder and use in a meat rub, or sneak a bit of one into a raspberry crumble served with vanilla ice cream.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Cold smoking versus hot smoking: what’s the difference? In cold smoking, the purpose is to flavor a food with smoke. The heat ranges from around 90 to 125 degrees Fahrenheit. The burning wood is held in another chamber and the smoke is pumped in to where evaporated sea salt basks in the smoldering aroma. A hot smoke means the food is getting cooked and flavored simultaneously. The food sits in the same chamber with the burning wood and temperatures range between 165 and 185 Fahrenheit.Hot smoking salt causes it to cook and become brittle, and the flavor to become metallic and bitter (like putting on an old penny on your tongue). Our smoked salt is carefully cold-smoked to ensure that the salt retains its textural pop when you bite into it while ensuring smoke seeps into every crystalline crevice.

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Black Hawaiian sea salt is formed when seawater is evaporated with purified lava rock and activated charcoal, a type of microporous carbon. The result is a brackish, atramentous salt that possesses striking color, flavor, and texture. The charcoal’s microporosity (meaning it has many pores and, thus, a high surface area) grants it detoxifying properties: the carbon cleans out the digestive system of stray materials and naturally absorbs pollutants and hazardous chemicals in the body.This salt’s dual oceanic flavor and slightly hot mineral flavor (often described as “volcanic”) makes it ideal for numerous applications. The ocean-y flavors of seafood are heightened when seasoned with Hawaiian black salt. In addition, its low moisture content means it will retain its shape and crunch when used to season wet foods such as watermelon, mangoes, or fire-roasted peppers. This salt should be used as a finishing salt and never as a cooking salt.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Gray sea salt, otherwise known as Sel Gris, was the backbone of the European salt trade for centuries. Carefully farmed seawater is dehydrated until only mineral-rich brine remains. This brine is further dehydrated into the delicate, winter cloud-colored, chunky salt.A high moisture content and minerality give this salt a sweet flavor, with hints of wet stone. You’ll find the granules melt quickly on the tongue and crunch apart easily. This finishing salt is perfect for meats right out of the oven or skillet.

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Alaea clay is a volcanic byproduct. When sea salt is evaporated it mixes with this clay that gets its color from high amounts of iron oxide. The result is a salt that has a slight flavor of clay and metal. It might sound off-putting, but the flavor is extremely pleasant. It’s a perfect finishing salt for root vegetables, white fish, and pork.Our Alaea red Hawaiian sea salt is essentially the same as pink salt, but the latter has less alaea clay. The result is less mineral in flavor allowing the salt itself to shine. Less clay also means less moisture, so the salt won’t melt. Instead, it stays rocky and shatters in a satisfying way when bitten into.Pink and red Hawaiian sea salts are also becoming very popular for use in confections. Often, it is paired with chocolate to intensify the bitter and sweet flavors.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Cold smoking versus hot smoking: what’s the difference? In cold smoking, the purpose is to flavor a food with smoke. The heat ranges from around 90 to 125 degrees Fahrenheit. The burning wood is held in another chamber and the smoke is pumped in to where evaporated sea salt basks in the smoldering aroma. A hot smoke means the food is getting cooked and flavored simultaneously. The food sits in the same chamber with the burning wood and temperatures range between 165 and 185 Fahrenheit.Hot smoking salt causes it to cook and become brittle, and the flavor to become metallic and bitter (like putting on an old penny on your tongue). Our smoked salt is carefully cold-smoked to ensure that the salt retains its textural pop when you bite into it while ensuring smoke seeps into every crystalline crevice. This sea salt was smoked low and slow, like a barbequed brisket done right. You can see it in the tea-colored crystals and smell it in the aroma.The hickory wood used to smoke it a wild, country smell that you could describe as dusty or barnyard-y. You’ll recognize the unique smell of hickory from some of your favorite Kansas City-style barbeque places where the telltale perfume ignites off of hickory-grilled steaks and ribs. If you’re planning to cure your own bacon, add an extra hit of smoke by rubbing it with a bit of this hickory smoked sea salt. It adds dimensions of both fresh and aged smoke that you won’t be able to find in any store.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>We have a few set ways we like to prepare seafood. More often than not we place the fish in foil and hit it with some parsley, lemon, butter, and a trickle of white wine. Wrap the foil tight and cook it in a 400F oven for about 15-30 minutes depending on the fish. Easy and no clean up needed.However, we also love to give the wine a rest and use our seafood spice blend. Lemon peel, garlic, sea salt, white pepper, smoked bittersweet paprika, thyme, allspice, and a few other spices create a soft but bold seafood seasoning mix that doesn’t overtake the flavor of the fish. Mash this seafood seasoning mix up with a spoonful of soft, unsalted butter and smear over the fish before popping it in the foil. Out will pop a life changing fish.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

This mixture is indeed spicy by Japanese standards, but true heatmongers will find it pleasant as opposed to molten. The kick comes from red chile pepper, but milder chiles are often added for their acidity and fruit-flavors. This blend also has ginger, sea salt, black and white sesame seeds, orange peel, ground nori (a type of seaweed often used for sushi), and sansho (a berry with a lemony-peppery flavor).Shichimi togarashi is often used as a condiment for soups and noodle dishes, but also tossed onto homemade crackers or other salty snacks.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Dating back thousands of years the dried shiitake has been used in medicine and cooking throughout Eastern Asia. The mushroom was often ground up or used in teas and prescribed for respiratory infections, to improve blood circulation, and to prevent aging. The fact that it tasted so otherworldly that it was thought to be a gift from the gods made it a medicine that many were happy to take.The shiitake is a mushroom that is always preferred dried over fresh. Dried and reconstituted, the mushroom has a far more intense flavor and the broth can be used for deglazing pans and adding to soup stocks. The woody stems are often discarded before drying as they’re usually inedible. The flavor is incredibly savory and umami-centric with hints of beef.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

Instead, the flavor is citric and it produces a tingly numbing sensation that is akin to touching your tongue to a battery or the fizziness from soda. So why eat it? Like a chile pepper, in certain amounts the sensation can be quite pleasing and causes the release of endorphins in the brain, which make you feel pleasure. Use ‘em once and you’ll be hooked forever.Sichuan peppercorns are a main ingredient in Chinese Five Spice Powder, and are often used alongside ingredients such as chile peppers, star anise, onion, vinegar, brown sugar, ginger, tangerine peel, and cinnamon in Sichuan cuisine. The ground peppers are perfect in a rub over duck, added to garlic-laden stir-fries, or added to crock pots for braised or stewed meats. If you make your own bacon then nothing is better than rubbing a slab of pork belly with ground Sichuan peppercorns.For years, this particular pericarp was banned from import into the United States because the peppercorns could carry citrus canker bacteria and infect citrus trees throughout the country. The ban was lifted in 2005 with the condition that all peppercorns be roasted at 158F to kill the bacteria.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Illicium verum is an evergreen tree that grows in Southern China, Laos, and Vietnam. The fruits that come forth from the tiny pink flowers are harvested and dried into the woody, aromatic, and brilliantly pretty spice we call star anise. These Ceylon-colored poinsettias have eight points, each containing a delicate seed looking like a polished bead.Star anise contains the essential oil, anethole, which gives both anise and star anise their licorice flavor (the two, however, are not related in any way). The flavor is fresh, muscular, floral, and penetrating.China and India both use the spice for medicinal purposes – mainly to treat indigestion. Often the tiny seeds are chewed or brewed into a tisane. The anethole actually does have the benefit of being able to calm down gastric activity while simultaneously freshening breath.The spice has been used in Asia for years as an ingredient for braises and stews, particularly those focusing on beef, pork, seafood, winter squash, and beans. However, Western cultures have adopted the spice more for confectionery cooking and baking, as well as for flavoring spirits. Add a few star anise to the poaching liquid for apples or figs. If you plan to candy citrus peel, toss a star anise into the blanching liquid to imbue a licorice fragrance.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Szechuan peppercorns do not produce a heat sensation like black or white pepper. Instead, the flavor is citric and it produces a tingly numbing sensation that is akin to touching your tongue to a battery or the fizziness from soda. So why eat it? Like a chile pepper, in certain amounts the sensation can be quite pleasing and causes the release of endorphins in the brain, which make you feel pleasure. Use ‘em once and you’ll be hooked forever.Szechuan peppercorns are a main ingredient in Chinese Five-Spice, and are often used alongside ingredients such as chile peppers, star anise, onion, vinegar, brown sugar, ginger, tangerine peel, and cinnamon in Sichuan cuisine. The ground peppers are perfect in a rub over duck, added to garlic-laden stir-fries, or added to crock pots for braised or stewed meats. If you make your own bacon then nothing is better than rubbing a slab of pork belly with ground Szechuan peppercorns.For years, this particular pericarp was banned from import into the United States because the peppercorns could carry citrus canker bacteria and infect citrus trees throughout the country. The ban was lifted in 2005 with the condition that all peppercorns be roasted at 158F to kill the bacteria.Coarsely ground, this is best used for stews and soups. It also works well in homemade cured meats and for giving pickles a curiously new zing.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Take a little bit of ground beef or slow roast some pork shoulder and flavor it all with our taco seasoning. For those of you who grew up with the pre-packaged pouches of taco seasoning, this has that same reminiscent flavor but without all the artificial colors, chemical flavors, and unnecessary preservatives. Paprika, chile powder, cayenne, cumin, onion and garlic powders, salt and a mix of food-based starches for thickening make this a winning and spicy blend.We love it on tacos, but use a pinch in chili con carne or dust over homemade French fries.

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Tamarind is a fruit that grows in wood vaneer-like pods. When the fruit is ripe the insides become dark brown and sticky like gummy candy. The flavor is deeply sour, sweet, and a little tangy. This fruit is popular in most the world minus North America where it is usually used as an ingredient in steak sauce.Tamarind powder is made from dehydrated and ground tamarind. The flavor is highly concentrated as opposed to fresh tamarind and is intensely more sweet-and-sour. The flavor is often used to add a puckeriness to sauces, chutneys, lentil and legume dishes, and pickles. In Western kitchens, chefs often use tamarind powder to craft BBQ sauces, ketchup, pizza sauces, and as a seasoning for wild game.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>The term “tandoori” originates from India and refers to the tandoor oven or tandoori. The oven is made of brick and clay and when fired can reach blazing temperatures of 500F. The intense heat and the immense smoke produced from the fire and the make of the oven ensure that food is quickly cooked and the juices sealed in.Tandoori spice is most commonly used in tandoori chicken. The recipe calls for chicken to be marinated in yogurt and then tossed in tandoori spice which is a spice mixture primarily known for its intensely red color – often brought on by cayenne, chiles, and tomato powder. The result is a fire engine red roast chicken with plenty of punch and crispy skin.Of course, if you’re looking to add a perky step to some classic American cuisine we highly recommend sprinkling this over a wedge salad slathered in blue cheese dressing or adding a dash to chicken pot pie.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>While widely considered a European herb due to the major varieties being French tarragon and Russian Tarragon, it was actually brought to Europe during the Arab rule over Spain in the 8th century. However, it truly was the French who brought tarragon into its culinary maturity.The flavor and aroma of tarragon is sweet with notes of basil, licorice, anise, and whispers of pine and grass. A mainstay of culinary cooking – particularly for chicken and fish – tarragon has a wide range of uses. Tarragon is also used for cream sauces, to flavor spirits, and makes for ethereally good pickles. During summer, use tarragon to season freshly picked squash and tomatoes, or mince and toss with feta cheese and marinate in olive oil for a heavenly salad ingredient.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>When archaeologists uncovered Ramses II, they found whole Tellicherry black peppercorns stuffed in his nostrils – this was part of the ritual mummification process. During the Age of Discovery, black pepper and the profit of the spice trade was one of the reasons Portugal, Spain, France, and other European nations sailed the world and expanded the map; to find new sources of spice. Nearly all pepper traded in the ancient world made its way through Malabar, on the Indian Peninsula, and is the main reason the region developed as a major port and trading post in the ancient world. Indeed, whole Tellicherry black peppercorns play a distinct part in human history that is more entrenched in the development of nations than we understand.They also taste so flippin’ good.Black pepper is used as a spice in nearly all the world’s cuisines as a pungent, spicy, heating agent for food due to the presence of capsaicin and piperine. Teasings of citrus and wood also add to black pepper’s allure.Tellicherry peppercorns have been left on the vine to ripen considerably. The result is a large, bloated peppercorn with a more distinguished flavor. The aroma is far more pungent and woodsy, with citrus notes that have a more pronounced Navel orange origin.Tellicherry peppercorns are named after the town of Tellicherry, a commercial town on the Malabar coast where special grafts of black peppercorn vines are grown for these particular berries. Tellicherry was of significant importance during the eras of the spice trade and the town became known for its particularly pungent peppercorns. The town was equally known for growing exceptionally fragrant green cardamom.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Thyme has always been a considered a plant that could grant courage. In fact, Medieval knights often tucked it in their armor as a charm when they went to war. This practice was understandable as the Greek word “thymus”, for which the herb was named after, means courage.Historically, it’s also been used as a source of medicine. The primary essential oil, thymol, has antiseptic properties and so the herb was used as an ancient disinfectant and antifungal cure. In fact, it’s still used for these reasons today and thymol is the active ingredient in most mouthwashes and organic disinfectants.Of course, we’re all most familiar with thyme in cooking. Kitchens from Iran, France, Portugal, Sweden, North Africa and everywhere in between all use thyme in their everyday cooking, though varieties can vary greatly in their scent and flavor.This dried thyme plant for sale has a robust, piney flavor with hints of camphor and bitterness. A must for developing bouquet garni. Thyme can be used in nearly all forms of cooking and baking.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Vadouvan is a delicious, savory aromatic spice blend that is the French interpretation of curry. It is heavenly and can be used in place of traditional curry powder. Vadouvan wonderful on everything from lamb to squash to deviled eggs to even popcorn.The French and British certainly had definite interest in India during the Age of Empire, so it isn’t too hard to believe that many of India’s flavors quickly became a part of the Western culinary landscape. French chefs, Welsh schools, and English cooks soon began keeping curry blends as a regular pantry staple the way one would keep salt pork or black pepper.Sadly, many Westerns’ dainty little palates were too darn sensitive to the deep, earthy, often spicy curry blends so special curries were developed. Vadouvan contained less ginger, chile pepper, and nigella. Instead cardamom, turmeric, mustard, shallots, and sugar were added to make it more palatable. Not that this was a bad thing. The simpler flavor had less to compete against and more chance to shine. With slow cooking they would gain a complexity not from a mélange of layered spices, but from their own unique and unchallenged flavors.Vadouvan spice can be used in place of any regular curry powder or curry blend. Fantastic with chicken and fish, but also lovely with grains, lentils, rice, or roasted root vegetables.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Indonesian beans are hefty and plump with plenty of caviar inside. Indonesian beans have a rustic, even slightly fermented flavor reminiscent of dried fruit. Expect scents of raisins, prunes, and dried figs. This homestead flavor makes Indonesian beans perfect for pies, compotes, and jams.After you’ve used the bean once or twice dry it out and use it as a component for making homemade bitters or liqueurs. When dried we also love to grind this fruity bean up and add it to homemade granola.Vanilla beans are one of the most unique, cherished, and utilized spices in the culinary world. In fact, one might say it well beats out saffron in each of these categories when you consider how nearly every home baker would fall into a state of collapse if their vanilla suddenly vanished.Vanilla beans are actually derived from orchid plants. The vanilla orchid flower isn’t a fancy one; it’s rather skinny, with no inflorescence, and a pale yellow pallor that can hardly be considered appealing. Yet the orchids of the genus Vanilla aren’t prized for their looks but the seed pods they produce. These seed pods are packed with vanillin – the fragrant organic compound responsible for vanilla flavor.Vanilla orchids require exhaustive effort and attention. To begin, they only grow in very specific climates and are notoriously sensitive, even with years of selective breeding to toughen them up. The plants are carefully grafted and trellised, then the flowers pollinated by hand. It then takes the seed pods six months to form and mature before they can be harvested. The pods then go through a complicated and extensive curing process that lasts another six months before being graded for quality based on size, appearance, moisture content, and aroma before being sold.Vanilla bean fans that we are we only sell the highest quality vanilla beans. You’ll find each one to be fat, black, fragrant and wet. In other words: perfect.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

These seed pods are packed with vanillin – the fragrant organic compound responsible for vanilla flavor.Vanilla orchids require exhaustive effort and attention. To begin, they only grow in very specific climates and are notoriously sensitive, even with years of selective breeding to toughen them up. The plants are carefully grafted and trellised, then the flowers pollinated by hand. It then takes the seed pods six months to form and mature before they can be harvested. The pods then go through a complicated and extensive curing process that lasts another six months before being graded for quality based on size, appearance, moisture content, and aroma before being sold.Vanilla bean fans that we are we only sell the highest quality vanilla beans. You’ll find each one to be fat, black, fragrant and wet. In other words: perfect.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Vindaloo curry powder originates from the Goa region of India. The Portuguese conquered the region in the 16th century and ruled for about 450 years until it was annexed by India in 1961. The Portuguese settlers, seeking comfort in food from home, developed a version of a classic adobo dish called vinha d'alhos made with red wine and chiles. Adapting to local ingredients, curry powder was used alongside Indian chiles, and vinegar was used instead of red wine. This recipe became known as curry vindaloo.Vindaloo curry powder is a mix of classic curry powder spices such as black pepper, ginger, and turmeric but with an intense, spicy heat from Indian chiles. Chicken and pork vindaloo are particularly popular dishes in Western Indian restaurants. Enhance your dishes with our flavorful vindaloo spice mix.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>White pepper and black pepper are actually the same fruit, sourced from a flowering vine. The only difference between them is how they are processed. Black pepper is formed when the fruits are picked when nearly ripe and are then roasted or dried out in the sun until the hulls turn dark black. For white pepper, the hull is removed during a cleaning process before it’s dried out.Since the essential oils are found in the hull, black pepper has more of that lemony, woody, characteristically peppery-pungent aroma. White pepper has less aroma and flavor, but a far sharper pungency and heat.Throughout history, pepper has been one of the most sought out spices. It was considered black gold by many and was worth even more than the shiny metal. It was only afforded to Europe’s wealthiest until around 1800 when it finally became more available. Today, pepper accounts for one-fifth of the world’s spice trade.White pepper is commonly used in sauces and mashed potatoes as it doesn’t discolor or mottle a uniform appearance as speckle-y black pepper would. In Chinese cuisines, white pepper is often preferred for its sharpness.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_INTRO>This tea is that friend you envy because they have their life just so together. She goes running every morning, has her career totally on track, she never forgets your birthday, and somehow still has time to spontaneously meet for drinks on a Wednesday night. And did you hear she’s planning a four week trip to Morocco? Ugh. Her perfection would drive you crazy if you didn’t like her so damn much and if she wasn’t one of your best friends ever.</SPICE_INTRO>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>These shredded Wood Ear mushrooms look like destroyed confidential files from a government office rather than food. Perhaps under all that black you might find some undisclosed secret kept hidden from the public.But no, these are mushrooms. Hydrated, these delicate strings of finely sliced Wood Ear mushroom become brown and crunchy with a forest-y flavor.Many chefs have begun to treat shredded Wood Ear like a pasta as instead of a mushroom. Add them to cold soba dishes, or tangle together with fettuccini and slather in an alfredo sauce for an East-meets-West dish. We like to add them into a chicken soup for their antiviral properties. Curious in texture, intriguing in flavor, and with a contemporary appearance this mushroom is perfect for the hip home cook.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>An accidental discovery, the first Worcestershire sauce was made in Worcester England, by John Wheeley Lea and William Perrins, a couple of pharmacists with a eye for culinary intrigue. Originally, the sauce was sold as both a flavoring and a digestive agent.The sauce in question was actually a British attempt to recreate a fermented fish sauce called garum, a popular flavoring used in Italy and Greece. The anchovy-based recipe was flavored with tamarind, cloves, malt vinegar, onion, molasses, and other ingredients. However, the resulting sauce was so completely inedible that the remaining barrels were shelved aside. After time, however, the sauce had mellowed and fermented taking on a lovely flavor.And that is Worcestershire sauce.This sauce is just that, but it’s been dehydrated and into a significantly more potent Worcestershire seasoning. Worcestershire powder can be mixed with water to form a quick sauce, but we also love it in rubs for ribs or sprinkled onto a steak or ham during the last bits of cooking so it can form a Worcestershire glaze.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Zaatar spice is the name of both a popular seasoning and herbal shrub found in the Middle East. Obviously, we're here to talk about the seasoning. Za atar is a zesty, sour, nutty spice blend that owes much of its flavor to sumac and to toasted sesame seeds. Salt is often added, but from there on it really depends on who is making it. Some commercial varieties also include roasted flour. Our blend comes with oregano and thyme to create an overly herbal salty-sour mix with plenty of earthiness from the sesame.Zaatar spice mix is often enjoyed as a condiment. Dip bread in your favorite olive oil, and then dip into a bowl of Zaatar for an easy appetizer with zing. Whip into butter, ricotta, or sour cream for tangy spread and dips. If you plan to make your own French fries or potato chips, sprinkle them with Zaatar once they finish cooking for a fragrant snack.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>
